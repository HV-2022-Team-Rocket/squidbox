      <p>Poetry is an important tool to share wisdom and express one's mind. 
        As programmers, words prove to be a vital tool, and as with poetry it 
        allows us to express and create art. This was the motivation behind SquidBox,
         in which users can view a feed of original poems, submitted in by other users.
          We aim to create a positive environment catered to mental health issues and a
           community founded on empowering others through poetry and creativity.</p>
