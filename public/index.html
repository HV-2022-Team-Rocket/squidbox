      <p>We are Team Rocket, a group of first time hackathoners who love all things computers! 
         As a novice group of people, we know firsthand how important access to educational resources is. 
         We believe that the right to learn is essential to the empowerment of individuals, and that education 
         enables each person to strive for their best self. In just 24 hours with some basic knowledge and the 
         power of the internet, we created SquidBox, a multistage hacking game dedicated to providing a fun and 
         engaging learning experience for coders of all skill levels. We can't wait to see what comes next. For 
         the first time: We're blasting off! </p>

      <h3 class="title" id="puzzles">Challenges</h3>
      <p>The SquidBox is an arena where SquidHats compete against other SquidHats in multi-stage puzzle games! 
        Our variety of handcrafted challenges are designed to test your problem solving skills against the clock 
        and other users. Evade elimination, and compete against your fellow SquidHats to be the first to complete 
        the challenge. What are you waiting for? Climb your way up the leaderboards and take your place among the 
        best! </p>
