## Introduction
<!--Introduction: goal of squidbox, inspiration, what it is-->
Poetry is an important tool to share wisdom and express one's mind. As programmers, words prove to be a vital tool, and as with poetry it allows us to express and create art. This was the motivation behind SquidBox, in which users can view a feed of original poems, submitted in by other users. We aim to create a positive environment catered to mental health issues and a community founded on empowering others through poetry and creativity.

## How it works
<!--Poem logic-->
Users can create profiles to scroll through a feed of original poetry, in addition to submitting their own poems to be added to the database, where their poems will also be featured on the feed with credit to the author.
## User Profile
<!--User Profile screenshot and what they can do-->
Users can create their profiles, with their username, email and password. This will allow them to be credited to the poems they posted. 
## Build Process
<!--Logic behind it (frontend, backend, user profile creation, poem submission, poem feed-->
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Apache and SQL to create SquidBox. The poems are stored in the SQL database and are displayed on the website, user submitted poems are also stored on the database. We also used BootStrap to make it interactive and pretty.
## Inspiration
<!--Where it was inspired from-->
As we all experienced, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many people, exasperating the need for mental health support. Each of us on Team Rocket know how powerful and inspirational words can be, so we decided to put words and mental health together in SquidBox.
