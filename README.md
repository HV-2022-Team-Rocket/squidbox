## Introduction
<!--Introduction: goal of squidbox, inspiration, what it is-->
Poetry is an important tool to share wisdom and express one's mind. As programmers, words prove to be a vital tool, and as with poetry it allows us to express and create art. This was the motivation behind SquidBox, in which users can view a feed of original poems, submitted in by other users. We aim to create a positive environment catered to mental health issues and a community founded on empowering others through poetry and creativity.

## Inspiration
<!--Where it was inspired from-->
As we all experienced, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many people, exasperating the need for mental health support. Each of us on Team Rocket know how powerful and inspirational words can be, so we decided to put words and mental health together in SquidBox.
